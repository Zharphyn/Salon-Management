a cookie is a browser technology
  (written by server, for the server to read, but stored on the client)
  (particular details about encoding etc)

HTTP is a "stateless protocol"
  when processing any given response, the server knows only about the request it is replying to

a "session", in a non-technical sense, is a conversation
in a more technical sense, a sequence of connected req/res cycles

cookies are a technology that exists for the purpose of implementing sessions


I want to store some data in a place that'll last through the session.
Some kind of storehouse, or "store" for short.  A "session store", if you will.



plan1
  just throw the session data in the cookie, whatever
  read it out using express oh wait what you cannot do that?  what?
      okay, fine.  require('cookie-parser');
      now we read the data from req.cookies, or some shit

plan2
  that manual cookie-writing shit is kinda low-tech.  I'm too cool.
  require('cookie-session')';
  read from req.session
